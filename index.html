      <p>The internet is so huge; no one will attack my computer. This is a common belief. And it’s a myth. Most hacking targets are vulnerable, unpatched computers that can be hijacked and used to launch a thousand attacks and more. Find out why it’s not personal but you’re just as much as a target as the big bank on the corner.
 

        It’s not surprising when mega hacks hit the headlines, millions of credit card details scooped in searing hack, millions of addresses and ID details lost to lax security, millions of email details, dates of birth and social security numbers swiped in audacious attack.
         
        
        It’s embarrassing for the companies involved not to mention the serious dent in their reputation. But often as a result we as individuals make unconscious assumptions that we are safe. The hackers are only going after the big fat boys, the ones with the wedge, the ones who can absorb the blows. This attitude is a mistake.
        
        Most hacks are based on sweeping and indiscriminate probes of all computers connected to the internet. Every computer is a target. These probes will detect if a computer is not protected and the information will be picked up by the hacker.
         
        
        Unprotected computers can be valuable for hackers because of their computing power and internet connections. A hacker can simply add it a botnet or use it as a zombie computer to send out spam and emails containing viruses and other malware, spread illicit materials or take part in hacking campaigns against other computer networks.</p>

        <p>With the increasing use of smartphones, QR codes are becoming popular. Recently, WhatsApp launched its web version, which needs QR code scanning to access the web version of WhatsApp. So, many people now know what QR code is, but still more are unaware. It is very similar to a bar code we see in products, but it does not need a different reader. Our smartphone camera can easily read it with the help of a QR code scanner app. Due to fast readability, it is now widely accepted. And the use of QR codes is increasing. With the scan of a QR code, we can perform various tasks which would otherwise need a lot more effort. For example, scan a QR code and save the business card details in your smartphone. This is why people like to use QR code scanning for general tasks. But most users are not aware that QR codes can also be malicious. This is why scammers are now using malicious QR codes for tricking users.</p>
        <p>QR code (or Quick Response code) is a matrix bar code which can be read by an imaging device (camera) and then processed to read its data. It was initially developed for the automotive industry in Japan, but now it is being used by many companies. You will be surprised to know that the QR code was invented back in 1994 by Denso Wave. Nowadays QR codes are being used to display text to users, to save a vCard contact information to the user’s smartphone, to open a website URL, to code payments, for website login (ex: WhatsApp web login) or to compose an e-mail or text message just by scanning a QR code.
          QR codes are really useful and help us to complete tasks faster in smartphones. You can quickly open a website just by scanning a QR code and you do not need to manually type the URL in your smartphone. This is why many websites’ poster ads now contain QR code. Another popular use is on a business card. Now people also include QR code in their business cards. So, other persons can simply scan the QR code to save the contact details in their smartphone.</p>
        <p>A QR code is the square matrix with small black square dots arrangement. Hacking a QR code means manipulation of the action without modifying the QR code. This is not possible. QR codes can be malicious and can trigger malicious action. But that QR code will not be the same as the legitimate QR code. Two QR codes with different actions will never be the same. You will certainly see different patterns in both QR codes. So, QR codes cannot be hacked. But It can be malicious and hackers can use a QR code for various malicious purposes. And there are various reports in which we have seen the malicious acts.</p>

    <p>Barcode scanners are not a new technology. They have been around for years. Used in grocery stores, retail, fast food restaurants and more recently on our mobile devices to pay for nearly anything and everything!In the past, you may have been worried about someone hacking an ATM or stealing your credit card number. But you probably have never considered the barcode scanner at nearly every retail establishment could be hacked! 
      Mobile payment has been on the rise every week. More than 4 million mobile transactions are initiated on the Starbucks mobile app. PayPal reported 227bn USD of payment volume in 2018, and 51% of mobile device owners have used a mobile retail app to buy a product or service in the past month. 28% used a mobile wallet app to pay in-store (e.g. Apple Pay, Starbucks App, etc).</p>
      <p>2D barcode technology may seem an unlikely place for hackers to target, but it does come with concerns in security due to the easy replication of the barcode. 2D technology is a one-way system that is made to only scan barcodes. Even though they are easily replicated, there is a smaller risk at this level. However, when barcodes go digital and interface with your entire mobile wallet, things become much more risky. Some of the most prominent companies, like Starbucks, have had issues with hackers gaining access to their barcode systems. Even airline boarding passes have been used to gain access to multitudes of personal information and accounts. Most barcode scanners leverage USB technology and function as a second keyboard to a computer with in-depth data behind each of the codes. If hackers gain access to the barcode scanner, they would gain full access to your computer. Once in, they could potentially disable a firewall, delete files, or give other hackers your IP address!Hackers use malicious barcodes to gain access to the barcode scanner. If successful, this access via the USB connection can wreak havoc on an entire system and be able to take over an entire network.   </p>

    <p>These are the different types of hackers:
      
      1. White Hat Hackers
      2. Black Hat Hackers
      3. Gray Hat Hackers
      4. Script Kiddies
      5. Green Hat Hackers
      6. Blue Hat Hackers
      7. Red Hat Hackers
      8. State/Nation Sponsored Hackers
      9. Hacktivist
      10. Malicious insider or Whistleblower</p>
      <p>White hat hackers are types of hackers who’re professionals with expertise in cybersecurity. They are authorized or certified to hack the systems. These White Hat Hackers work for governments or organizations by getting into the system. They hack the system from the loopholes in the cybersecurity of the organization. This hacking is done to test the level of cybersecurity in their organization. By doing so, they identify the weak points and fix them to avoid attacks from external sources. White hat hackers work as per the rules and regulations set by the government.  White hat hackers are also known as ethical hackers.
        
        Black hat hackers are also knowledgeable computer experts but with the wrong intention. They attack other systems to get access to systems where they do not have authorized entry. On gaining entry they might steal the data or destroy the system. The hacking practices used by these types of hackers depend on the individual’s hacking capacity and knowledge. As the intentions of the hacker make the hacker a criminal. The malicious action intent of the individual cannot be gauged either can the extent of the breach while hacking
        
        The Gray hat hacker falls in between the black hat hackers and white hat hackers. They are not certified, hackers. These types of hackers work with either good or bad intentions. The hacking might be for their gain. The intention behind hacking decides the type of hacker. If the intention is for personal gain then the hacker is considered to be a gray hat hacker.
        
        The Script Kiddies are amateurs types of hackers in the field of hacking. They try to hack the system with scripts from other fellow hackers. They try to hack the systems, networks, or websites. The intention behind the hacking is just to get attention from their peers. Script Kiddies are juveniles who do not have complete knowledge of the hacking process.
        
        Green hat hackers are types of hackers who’re learning the ropes of hacking. They are slightly different from the Script Kiddies due to their intention. The intent is to strive and learn to become full-fledged hackers. They are looking for opportunities to learn from experienced hackers.
        
        Blue Hat Hackers are types of hackers who’re similar to Script Kiddies. The intent to learn is missing. They use hacking as a weapon to gain popularity among their fellow beings. They use hacking to settle scores with their adversaries. Blue Hat Hackers are dangerous due to the intent behind the hacking rather than their knowledge.
        
        Red Hat Hackers are synonymous with Eagle-Eyed Hackers. They are the types of hackers who’re similar to white hackers. The red hat hackers intend to stop the attack of black hat hackers. The difference between red hat hackers and white hat hackers is in the process of hacking through intention remains the same. Red hat hackers are quite ruthless while dealing with black hat hackers or counteracting with malware. The red hat hackers continue to attack and may end up having to replace the entire system set up.
        
        Above are 7 types of hackers broadly referred to in the cybersecurity world. The three types of hackers listed below work in different capacities.
        
        State/Nation Sponsored Hackers. Government appoints hackers to gain information about other countries. These types of hackers are known as State/Nation sponsored hackers. They use their knowledge to gain confidential information from other countries to be well prepared for any upcoming danger to their country. The sensitive information aids to be on top of every situation but also to avoid upcoming danger. They report only to their governments.
        
        Hacktivist, these types of hackers intend to hack government websites. They pose themselves as activists, so known as a hacktivist. Hacktivist can be an individual or a bunch of nameless hackers whose intent is to gain access to government websites and networks. The data gained from government files accessed are used for personal political or social gain.
        
        Malicious insider or Whistleblower, these types of hackers include individuals working in an organization who can expose confidential information. The intent behind the exposure might be a personal grudge with the organization or the individual might have come across the illegal activities within the organization. The reason for expose defines the intent behind the exposure. These individuals are known as whistleblowers. </p>

    <p>How will I know if I've been hacked?

      Check the accuracy of your personal accounts, credit cards, and documents. Are there unexplained transactions? Questionable or unauthorized changes? If so, dangerous malware installed by predators or hackers may already be lurking.
      
      What can I do about computer hackers and predators?
      
      When you arm yourself with information and resources, you’re wiser about computer security threats and less vulnerable to threat tactics. Hackers and predators pose equally serious and but very different threats.
      
      Protect yourself while online
      Continually check the accuracy of personal accounts and deal with any discrepancies right away
      Use extreme caution when entering chat rooms or posting personal Web pages
      Limit the personal information you post on a personal Web pages
      Carefully monitor requests by online “friends” or acquaintances for predatory behavior
      Keep personal and financial information out of online conversations
      Use extreme caution when agreeing to meet an online “friend” or acquaintance in person
      Security Tips to Prevent Hacking 
      Use a 2-way firewall
      Update your operating system regularly
      Increase your browser security settings
      Avoid questionable Web sites
